ABOUT NOOBO ENGINE
NoobO Engine is a humble attempt to make a basic 2D engine that is flexible and easy to use. The focus of the engine isn't to achieve complex graphics (lighting, shaders, ...) but to be a quick tool to make a game from scratch and learn a few things while using it.

This engine is coded in C# using SDL2. Games made with this engine should run in Windows, Linux and Mac but I'm only focusing on coding a visual editor for Windows since it's the most common OS and the one I have more knowledge on.

This engine is heavily based on Unity3D architecture because I think they made a really good job on it.


CURRENT TO-DO LIST
- Render things

IMPLEMENTED THINGS
- Basic engine logic
- Basic architecture
- Useless visual editor
